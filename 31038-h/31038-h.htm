<h1>THE REAL HARD
SELL</h1>

<p class="author">BY WILLIAM W. STUART</p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">B</span><span class="uc">en Tilman</span> sat down in
the easiest of all easy
chairs. He picked up a magazine,
flipped pages; stood up,
snapped fingers; walked to
the view wall, walked back;
sat down, picked up the magazine.</p>

<p>He was waiting, near the
end of the day, after hours, in
the lush, plush waiting room&mdash;&ldquo;The
customer&#8217;s ease is the
Sales Manager&#8217;s please&rdquo;&mdash;to
see the Old Man. He was fidgety,
but not about something.
About nothing. He was irritated
at nobody, at the world;
at himself.</p>

<p>He was irritated at himself
because there was no clear
reason for him to be irritated
at anything.</p>

<p>There he sat, Ben Tilman,
normally a cheerful, pleasant
young man. He was a salesman
like any modern man and
a far better salesman than
most. He had a sweet little
wife, blonde and pretty. He
had a fine, husky two-year-old
boy, smart, a real future National
Sales Manager. He
loved them both. He had every
reason to be contented with
his highly desirable, comfortable
lot.</p>

<p>And yet he had been getting
more sour and edgy ever since
about six months after the
baby came home from the
Center and the novelty of responsibility
for wife and child
had worn off. He had now
quit three jobs, good enough
sales jobs where he was doing
well, in a year. For no reason?
<a name="png.002" id="png.002"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>For petty, pointless reasons.</p>

<p>With Ancestral Insurance,
&ldquo;Generations of Protection,&rdquo;
he&#8217;d made the Billion Dollar
Club&mdash;and immediately begun
to feel dissatisfied with it&mdash;just
before cute, sexy, blonde
Betty had suddenly come from
nowhere into his life and he
had married her. That had
helped, sure. But as soon after
that as he had started paying
serious attention to his job
again, he was fed up with it.
&ldquo;Too much paper work. All
those forms. It&#8217;s work for a
robot, not a man,&rdquo; he&#8217;d told
Betty when he quit. A lie. The
paper work was, as he looked
back on it, not bad at all;
pleasant even, in a way. It
was just&mdash;nothing. Anything.</p>

<p>Indoor-Outdoor Climatizers&mdash;sniffles,
he said, kept killing
his sales presentation even
though his record was good
enough. Ultra-sonic toothbrushes,
then, were a fine
product. Only the vibration,
with his gold inlay, seemed to
give him headaches after every
demonstration. He didn&#8217;t
<em>have</em> a gold inlay. But the
headaches were real enough.
So he quit.</p>

<p>So now he had a great new
job with a great organization,
Amalgamated<!-- original reads 'Almagamated' --> Production for
Living&mdash;ALPRODLIV. He
was about to take on his first
big assignment.</p>

<p>For that he had felt a spark
of the old enthusiasm and it
had carried him into working
out a bright new sales
<!-- 003.png p26 column 2 -->approach for the deal tonight.
The Old Man himself had
taken a personal interest,
which was a terrific break.
And still Ben Tilman felt that
uneasy dissatisfaction. Damn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robb will see you now,
Mr. Tilman,&rdquo; said the cool robot
voice from the Elec-Sec
Desk. It was after customer
hours and the charming human
receptionist had gone.
The robot secretary, like most
working robots, was functional
in form&mdash;circuits and
wires, mike, speaker, extension
arms to type and to reach
any file in the room, wheels
for intra-office mobility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, hon,&rdquo; said Ben.
Nevertheless, robot secretaries
were all programmed
and rated female&mdash;and it was
wise to be polite to them. After
all, they could think and
had feelings. There were a lot
of important things they could
do for a salesman&mdash;or, sometimes,
not do. This one, being
helpful, stretched out a long
metal arm to open the door to
the inner office for Ben. He
smiled his appreciation and
went in.<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="uc">he</span> Old Man, Amalgamated&#8217;s
grand old salesman,
was billiard bald, aging, a little
stout and a little slower
now. But he was still a fine
sales manager. He sat at his
huge, old fashioned oak desk
as Ben walked across the
office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evening, sir.&rdquo; No
<a name="png.004" id="png.004"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>response. Louder, &ldquo;Good evening,
Mr. Robb. Mr. Robb, it&#8217;s
Ben, sir. Ben Tilman. You
memo&#8217;d me to <span class="nw">come&mdash;</span>&rdquo; Still
no sign. The eyes, under the
great, beetling brows, seemed
closed.</p>

<p>Ben grinned and reached
out across the wide desk toward
the small, plastic box
hanging on the Old Man&#8217;s
chest. The Old Man glanced
up as Ben tapped the plastic
lightly with his fingernail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben. It&#8217;s you.&rdquo; The Old
Man raised his hand to adjust
the ancient style hearing aid
he affected as Ben sank into
a chair. &ldquo;Sorry Ben. I just
had old Brannic Z-IX in here.
A fine old robot, yes, but like
most of that model, long-winded.
<span class="nw">So&mdash;</span>&rdquo; He gestured at the
hearing aid.</p>

<p>Ben smiled. Everyone knew
the Old Man used that crude
old rig so he could pointedly
tune out conversations he
didn&#8217;t care to hear. Any time
you were talking to him and
that distant look came into his
half closed eyes, you could be
sure that you were cut off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Ben. Well now. I
simply wanted to check with
you, boy. Everything all set
for tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, sir. Everything
is set and programmed. Betty
and I will play it all evening
for the suspense, let them
wonder, build it up&mdash;and
then, instead of the big pitch
they&#8217;ll be looking for, we&#8217;ll let
it go easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- 005.png p27 column 2 -->&ldquo;A new twist on the old
change-up. Ben, boy, it&#8217;s going
to go. I feel it. It&#8217;s in the air,
things are just ripe for a new,
super-soft-sell pitch. Selling
you&#8217;ve got to do by feel, eh
Ben? By sales genius and the
old seat of the pants. Good.
After tonight I&#8217;m going all
out, a hemisphere-wide, thirty
day campaign.<!-- original lacks period --> I&#8217;ll put the top
sales artist of every regional
office on it. They can train on
your test pattern tapes. I believe
we can turn over billions
before everybody picks up the
signal and it senilesces. You
give an old man a new faith
in sales, Ben! You&#8217;re a <em>salesman</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <span class="nw">sir&mdash;</span>&rdquo; But the Old
Man&#8217;s knack with the youthful-enthusiasm
approach was
contagious. For the moment
Ben caught it and he felt
pretty good about the coming
night&#8217;s work. He and Betty
together would put the deal
over. That would be something.</p>

<p>Sure it would&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you and your wife
like the place, Ben?&rdquo; It was
some place, for sure, the brand
new house that Amalgamated
had installed Ben, Betty and
Bennie in the day after he had
signed up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s&mdash;uh&mdash;just fine, sir.
Betty likes it very much,
really. We both do.&rdquo; He hoped
his tone was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, Ben. Well, be sure
to stop by in the morning.
I&#8217;ll have the tapes, of course,
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>but I&#8217;ll want your analysis.
Might be a little vacation
bonus in it for you, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I don&#8217;t know how to
thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Old Man waved a hand.
&ldquo;Nothing you won&#8217;t have
earned, my boy. Robots can&#8217;t
sell.&rdquo; That was the set dismissal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Robots can&#8217;t manage
sales, <span class="nw">or&mdash;</span>&rdquo; He winked.
The Old Man chuckled. An old
joke was never too old for the
Old Man. The same old bromides
every time; and the
same hearty chuckle. Ben left
on the end of it.<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">D</span><span class="uc">ialing</span> home on his new,
Company-owned, convertible
soar-kart, he felt not too
bad. Some of the old lift in
spirits came as the kart-pilot
circuits digested the directions,
selected a route and
zipped up into a north-north-west
traffic pattern. The Old
Man was a wonderful sales
manager and boss. The new
house-warming pitch that he
and Betty would try tonight
was smart. He could feel he
had done something.</p>

<p>Exercising his sales ability
with fair success, he fed himself
this pitch all along the
two hundred mile, twenty-minute
hop home from the
city. The time and distance
didn&#8217;t bother him. &ldquo;Gives me
time to think,&rdquo; he had told
Betty. Whether or not this
seemed to her an advantage,
she didn&#8217;t say. At least she
<!-- 007.png p28 column 2 -->liked the place,
 &ldquo;Amalgamated&#8217;s<!-- original reads "Almalgamated's" -->
Country Gentleman
Estate&mdash;Spacious, Yet fully
Automated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; the Old Man told
Ben when he was given the
Company-assigned quarters,
&ldquo;starting a new trend. With
the terrific decline in birth
rate during the past 90 to 100
years, you&#8217;ll be astonished at
how much room there is out
there. No reason for everyone
to live in the suburban centers
any more. With millions
of empty apartments in them,
high time we built something
else, eh? Trouble with people
today, no initiative in obsolescing.
But we&#8217;ll move them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Home, Ben left the kart out
and conveyed up the walk. The
front door opened. Betty had
been watching for him. He
walked to the family vueroom,
as usual declining to convey
in the house. The hell with
the conveyor&#8217;s feelings, if so
simple a robot really had any.
He <em>liked</em> to walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Color pattern,&rdquo; Betty ordered
the vuescreen as he
came in, &ldquo;robot audio out.&rdquo;
With people talking in the
house it was still necessary to
put the machines under master
automatic and manual
control. Some of the less
sophisticated robots might
pick up some chance phrase of
conversation and interpret it
as an order if left on audio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; said Betty, getting
up to meet him, &ldquo;you&#8217;re late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben was too good a salesman
<a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to argue that. Instead,
he took her in his arms and
kissed her. It was a very good
sixty seconds later that she
pushed him away with a
severeness destroyed by a
blush and a giggle to say,
&ldquo;Late but making up for lost
time, huh? And sober, too.
You must be feeling good for
a change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;and you feel even
better, sugar.&rdquo; He reached for
her again. She slipped away
from him, laughing, but his
wrist tel-timer caught on the
locket she always wore, her
only memento<!-- original reads 'momento' --> from her parents,
dead in the old moon-orb
crash disaster. She stood still,
slightly annoyed, as he unhooked
and his mood was, not
broken, but set back a little.
&ldquo;What&#8217;s got into you tonight
anyway, Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Did I
tell you, the O.M. may give
us a vacation? Remember
some of those nights up at
that new &lsquo;Do It Yourself&rsquo;
Camp last summer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo; She blushed, smiled.
&ldquo;We won&#8217;t get any vacation
if we blow our house-warming
pitch tonight, you know. And
we have three couples due
here in less than a half hour.
Besides, I have to talk to you
about Nana.&rdquo;<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">&ldquo;T</span><span class="uc">hat</span> damned new CD-IX
model. Now what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&#8217;s very upset about
Bennie. I&#8217;m not sure I blame
her. This afternoon he simply
<!-- 009.png p29 column 2 -->refused his indoctrination. All
the time he should have been
playing store with Playmate
he insisted on <em>drawing</em> things&mdash;himself,
mind you, not
Playmate. On the walls, with
an old pencil of yours he
found someplace in your
things. Nana couldn&#8217;t do a
thing with him. She says
you&#8217;ve got to give him a spanking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why me? Why not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Ben, we&#8217;ve been over
that and over it. Discipline is
the father&#8217;s job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&#8217;t do it. Bennie&#8217;s
just a baby. Let him do
a few things himself. Won&#8217;t
hurt him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Nana is an officious
busybody, trying to run our
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben! You know Nana
loves little Bennie. She only
wants to help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&#8217;d never dream of lifting
a finger against Bennie no
matter what he did. And she
lives in terror that he&#8217;ll cut
her switch in some temper tantrum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmph! Well, I&#8217;m going up
right now and tell her if I
hear another word from her
about spanking Bennie, I&#8217;ll
cut her switch myself. Then
she can go back to Central for
reprogramming and see how
she likes it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben! You wouldn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Maybe she needs
a new personality?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;You won&#8217;t say a thing to
her. You&#8217;re too soft-hearted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time I won&#8217;t be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time he wasn&#8217;t. He met
Nana CD-IX in the hallway
outside Bennie&#8217;s room. Like
all nurse, teaching, and children&#8217;s
personal service robots,
she was human in form, except
for her control dial safely
out of baby&#8217;s reach, top, center.</p>

<p>The human form was reassuring
to children, kept
them from feeling strange
with parents<!-- original reads "parent's" --> back. Nana was
big, gray-haired, stout, buxom,
motherly, to reassure parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Tilman,&rdquo; she
said with weary impatience,
&ldquo;you are too late. Surely you
don&#8217;t intend to burst in and
disturb your son now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is having his supper.
You will upset him. Can&#8217;t
you understand that you
should arrange to be here between
5:30 and 6 if you wish
to interview the child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he miss me? Sorry, I
couldn&#8217;t make it earlier. But
now I am going to see him a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tilman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nana! And what&#8217;s this
about your wanting Bennie
spanked because he drew a
few pictures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you realize these
are the child&#8217;s formative
years, Mr. Tilman. He should
be learning to think in terms
of selling now&mdash;not <em>doing</em>
things. That&#8217;s robot work, Mr.
<!-- 011.png p30 column 2 -->
Tilman. Robots can&#8217;t sell, you
know, and what will people,
let alone robots think if you
let your boy grow <span class="nw">up&mdash;</span>&rdquo;<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">&ldquo;H</span><span class="uc">e</span>&#8217;s growing up fine; and
I am going in to see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tilman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And</em> for two credits, Nana,
I&#8217;d cut your switch. You hear
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tilman&mdash;no! No,
please. I&#8217;m sorry. Let the boy
scrawl a bit; perhaps it won&#8217;t
hurt him. Go in and see him
if you must, but do try not to
upset him <span class="nw">or&mdash;</span> All right, all
right. But please Mr. Tilman,
my <span class="nw">switch&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well Nana. I&#8217;ll leave
it. This time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Tilman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we understand each
other, Nana. Though, matter
of fact, I&#8217;m hanged if I ever
did quite see why you senior-level
robots get so worked up
about your identities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&#8217;t you, Mr. Tilman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. But&mdash;well, yes,
I suppose I do see, in a way.
Let&#8217;s go see Bennie-boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Ben Tilman went into
the nursery and enjoyed every
second of a fast fifteen-minute
roughhouse with his round-faced,
laughing, chubby son
and heir. No doubt it was
very bad, just after supper.
But Nana, with a rather humanly
anxious restraint, confined
herself to an unobtrusive
look of disapproval.</p>

<p><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He left Bennie giggling and
doubtless upset, at least to a
point of uneagerness for
Nana&#8217;s bedtime story about
Billie the oldtime newsboy,
who sold the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p>So then he was run through
a fast ten-minute shower,
shave and change by Valet.
He floated downstairs just as
Betty came out of the cocktail
lounge to say, &ldquo;Code 462112
on the approach indicator.
Must be the Stoddards. They
always get every place first,
in time for an extra drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred and Alice, yes. But
damn their taste for gin, don&#8217;t
let Barboy keep the cork in
the vermouth all evening. I
like a touch of vermouth. I
wonder if maybe I <span class="nw">shouldn&#8217;t&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you shouldn&#8217;t mix the
cocktails yourself and scandalize
everybody. You know
perfectly well Barboy really
does do better anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe. Everything
all set, hon? Sorry I was late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trouble here. I just fed
Robutler the base program
this morning and spent the
rest of the day planning my
side of our Sell. How to tantalize
the girls, pique the curiosity
without giving it away.
But you <span class="nw">know&mdash;</span>&rdquo; she laughed
a little ruefully&mdash;&ldquo;I sort of
miss not having even the
shopping to do. Sometimes it
hardly seems as though you
need a wife at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben slid an arm around her
waist. &ldquo;Selling isn&#8217;t the only
<!-- 013.png p31 column 2 -->thing robots can&#8217;t do, sugar.&rdquo;
He pulled her close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben! They&#8217;re at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were, and then in the
door, oh-ing and ah-ing over
this and that. And complimenting
Barboy on the martinis.
Then the Wilsons came
and the Bartletts and that
was it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three couples will be
right,&rdquo; Ben had analyzed it.
&ldquo;Enough so we can let them
get together and build up each
others&#8217; curiosity but not too
many for easy control. People
that don&#8217;t know us so well
they might be likely to guess
the gimmick. We&#8217;ll let them
stew all evening while they
enjoy the Country Gentleman
House-Warming hospitality.
Then, very casually, we toss
it out and let it lie there in
front of them. They will be
sniffing, ready to nibble. The
clincher will drive them right
in. I&#8217;d stake my sales reputation
on it.&rdquo; If it matters a
damn, he added. But silently.</p>

<p>They entertained three couples
at their house-warming
party. It was a delightful party,
a credit to Ben, Betty and
the finest built-in house robots
the mind of Amalgamated
could devise.</p>

<p>By ten o&#8217;clock they had
dropped a dozen or more random
hints, but never a sales
pitch. Suspense was building
nicely when Betty put down
an empty glass and unobtrusively
pushed the button to
cue Nana. Perfect timing.
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>They apologized to the guests,
&ldquo;We&#8217;re ashamed to be so old-fashioned
but we feel better
if we look in on the boy when
he wakes in the night. It keeps
him from forgetting us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they floated off upstairs
together, ostensibly to
see Nana and little Bennie.</p>

<p>Fred Stoddard: &ldquo;Some place
they have here, eh? Off-beat.
A little too advanced for my
taste, this single dwelling
idea, but maybe&mdash;Ben sure
must have landed something
juicy with Amalgamated to
afford this. What the devil is
he pushing, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scoville Wilson (shrug):
&ldquo;Beats me. You know, before
dinner I cornered him at the
bar to see if I could slip in a
word or two of sell. Damned
if he didn&#8217;t sign an order for
my Cyclo-sell Junior Tape Library
without<!-- original reads 'with out' --> even a C level
resistance. Then he talked a
bit about the drinks and I
thought sure he was pushing
that new model Barboy. I was
all set to come back with a
sincere &lsquo;think it over&rsquo;&mdash;and
then he took a bottle from the
Barboy, added a dash of vermouth
to his drink and walked
off without a word of sell. He
always was an odd one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucy Wilson (turns from
woman talk with the other
two wives): &ldquo;Oh no! I knew
it wasn&#8217;t the Barboy set. They
wouldn&#8217;t have him set so slow.
Besides didn&#8217;t you hear the
way she carried on about the
nursery and that lovely Nana?
<!-- 015.png p32 column 2 -->That must have been a build-up,
but Ben goofed his cue to
move in on Sco and me for a
close. Doesn&#8217;t Amalgamated
handle those nurseries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Bartlett: &ldquo;Amalgamated
makes almost anything.
That&#8217;s the puzzle. I dunno&mdash;but
it must be something big.
He has to hit us with something,
doesn&#8217;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Belle Bartlett: &ldquo;Who ever
heard of a party without a
sell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy Stoddard: &ldquo;Who ever
heard of a party going past
ten without at least a warm-up
pitch? And Betty promised
Fred to send both Ben
and Bennie to the Clinic for
their Medchecks. You know
we have the newest, finest
<span class="nw">diagnosticians&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred Stoddard: &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy Stoddard: &ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;m
sorry. I shouldn&#8217;t be selling
you folks at <em>their</em> party,
should I? Come to think,
you&#8217;re all signed with Fred
anyway, aren&#8217;t you? Well,
about Ben, <em>I</em> <span class="nw">think&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucy Wilson: &ldquo;Sh-h-h!
Here they come.&rdquo;<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">S</span><span class="uc">miling</span>, charming&mdash;and
still not an order form in
sight&mdash;Ben and Betty got
back to their guests. Another
half hour. Barboy was passing
around with nightcaps.
Lucy Wilson nervously put a
reducegar to her sophisticated,
peppermint-striped lips.</p>

<p>Quickly Ben Tilman was on
his feet. He pulled a small,
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>metal cylinder from his pocket
with a flourish and held it
out on his open palm toward
Lucy. A tiny robot Statue of
Liberty climbed from the cylinder,
walked across Ben&#8217;s
hand, smiled, curtsied and
reached out to light the reducegar
with her torch, piping
in a high, thin voice,
&ldquo;Amalgamated reducegars are
cooler, lighter, finer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben! How simply darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like it? It&#8217;s a new
thing from Amalgamated NovelDiv.
You can program it for
up to a hundred selective sell
phrases, audio or visio key.
Every salesman should have
one. Makes a marvelous gift,
and surprisingly reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&#8217;s it, Ben. I just
love it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! It&#8217;s yours, compliments
of Amalgamated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;then you&#8217;re not selling
them? Well, what on
earth&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it, Ben,&rdquo; Fred Stoddard
broke in, &ldquo;come on,
man, out with it. What in hell
<em>are</em> you selling? You&#8217;ve given
us the shakes. What is it? The
Barboy set? It&#8217;s great. If I
can scrape up the down payment,
<span class="nw">I&#8217;ll&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>After</em> we furnish a nursery
with a decent Nana, Fred
Stoddard,&rdquo; Nancy snapped,
&ldquo;and get a second soar-kart.
Ben isn&#8217;t selling Barboys anyway,
are you. Ben? It <em>is</em> that
sweet, sweet Nana, isn&#8217;t it?
And I do want one, the whole
nursery, Playmate and all,
<!-- 017.png p33 column 2 -->girl-programmed of course,
for our Polly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Is</em> it the nursery, Betty?&rdquo;
Lucy pitched in her credit&#8217;s
worth. &ldquo;Make him tell us,
darling. We have enjoyed
everything so much, the dinner,
the Tri-deo, this whole
lovely, lovely place of yours.
Certainly the house warming
has been perfectly charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&#8217;s it,&rdquo; said Ben
smiling, a sheaf of paper
forms suddenly in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Not&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house, yes. Amalgamated&#8217;s
Country Gentleman
Estate, complete, everything
in it except Bennie, Betty and
me. Your equity in your Center
co-op can serve as down
payment, easy three-generation
terms, issue insurance.
Actually, I can show you how,
counting in your entertainment,
vacation, incidental, and
living expenses, the Country
Gentleman will honestly cost
you less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How simply too clever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben let it rest there. It was
enough. Fred Stoddard, after
a short scuffle with Scoville
Wilson for the pen, signed the
contract with a flourish. Sco
followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, Ben,&rdquo; said Betty,
holding Bennie a little
awkwardly in her arms in the
soar-kart. They had moved
out so the Stoddards could
move right in. Now they were
on their way in to their
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>reserved suite at Amalgamated&#8217;s
Guest-ville. &ldquo;You were absolutely
marvellous. Imagine
selling all three of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There wasn&#8217;t anything to
it, actually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben, how can you say
that? Nobody else could have
done it. It was a sales masterpiece.
And just think. Now
salesmen all over the hemisphere
are going to follow your
sales plan. Doesn&#8217;t it make
you proud? Happy? Ben, you
aren&#8217;t going to be like <em>that</em>
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, of course he wasn&#8217;t. He
was pleased and proud. Anyway,
the Old Man would be,
and that, certainly, was something.
A man had to feel good
about winning the approval of
Amalgamated&#8217;s grand Old
Man. And it did seem to make
Betty happy.</p>

<p>But the actual selling of the
fool house and even the two
other, identical houses on the
other side of the hill&mdash;he just
couldn&#8217;t seem to get much of
a glow over it. He had done
it; and what had he done? It
was the insurance and the
toothbrushes all over again,
and the old nervous, sour feeling
inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least we do have a vacation
trip coming out of it,
hon. The O.M. practically
promised it yesterday, if our
sell sold. We <span class="nw">could&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;go back to that queer
new &lsquo;Do It Yourself&rsquo; camp up
on the lake you insisted on
dragging me to the last week
<!-- 019.png p34 column 2 -->of our vacation last summer.
Ben, really!&rdquo; He <em>was</em> going to
be like that. She knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even you admitted it
was some fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sort of, I suppose. For
a little while. Once you got
used to the whole place without
one single machine that
could think or do even the
simplest little thing by itself.
So, well, almost like being
savages. Do you think it
would be safe for Bennie? We
can&#8217;t watch him all the time,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People used to manage in
the old days. And remember
those people, the Burleys, who
were staying up there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That queer, crazy bunch
who went there for a vacation
when the Camp was first
opened and then just stayed?
Honestly, Ben! Surely you&#8217;re
not thinking <span class="nw">of&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing like that. Just
a vacation. <span class="nw">Only&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only those queer, peculiar
people, the Burleys had seemed
so relaxed and cheerful.
Grandma and Ma Burley
cleaning, washing, cooking on
the ancient electric stove;
little Donnie, being a nuisance,
poking at the keys on his
father&#8217;s crude, manual typewriter,
a museum piece; Donnie
and his brothers wasting
away childhood digging and
piling sand on the beach, paddling
a boat and actually
building a play house. It was
mad. People playing robots.
And yet, they seemed to have
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a wonderful time while they
were doing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do you keep staying
here?&rdquo; he had asked Buck
Burley, &ldquo;Why don&#8217;t they put
you out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Buck. &ldquo;How?
Nobody can sell me on leaving.
We like it here. No robot
can force us out. Here we are.
Here we stay.&rdquo;<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="uc">hey</span> pulled into the Guest-ville
ramp. Bennie was
fussy; the nursery Nana was
strange to him. On impulse,
Betty took him in to sleep in
their room, ignoring the disapproving
stares of both the
Nana and the Roboy with
their things.</p>

<p>They were tired, let down.
They went to bed quietly.</p>

<p>In the morning Betty was
already up when Ben stumbled
out of bed. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she said,
nervously cheerful. &ldquo;The
house Nanas all had overload
this morning and I won&#8217;t
stand for any of those utility
components with Bennie. So
I&#8217;m taking care of him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bennie chortled and drooled
vita-meal at his high-chair,
unreprimanded. Ben mustered
a faint smile and turned to go
dial a shave, cool shower and
dress at Robather.</p>

<p>That done, he had a bite of
breakfast. He felt less than
top-sale, but better. Last night
<em>had</em> gone well. The Old Man
would give them a pre-paid
vacation clearance to any
<!-- 021.png p35 column 2 -->resort in the world or out. Why
gloom?</p>

<p>He rubbed Bennie&#8217;s unruly
hair, kissed Betty and conveyed
over from Guest-ville to
office.</p>

<p>Message-sec, in tone respect-admiration
A, told him
the Old Man was waiting for
him. Susan, the human receptionist
in the outer office, favored
him with a dazzling
smile. There was a girl who
could sell; and had a product
of her own, too.</p>

<p>The Old Man was at his
big, oak desk but, a signal
honor, he got up and came
half across the room to grab
Ben&#8217;s hand and shake it. &ldquo;Got
the full report, son. Checked
the tapes already. That&#8217;s selling,
boy! I&#8217;m proud of you.
Tell you what, Ben. Instead
of waiting for a sales slack,
I&#8217;m going to move you and
that sweet little wife of yours
right into a spanking new,
special Country Gentleman
unit I had in mind for myself.
And a nice, fat boost in your
credit rating has already gone
down to accounting. Good?
Good. Now, Ben, I have a real,
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 in the original, this line was printed between 'Good?' and 'Good.'
 and has been moved to restore the sense">artistic sales challenge that is</ins>
crying for your talent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir? Thank you. But, sir,
there is the matter of the <span class="nw">vacation&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vacation? Sure, Ben. Take
a vacation anytime. But right
now it seems to the Old Man
you&#8217;re on a hot selling streak.
I don&#8217;t want to see you get
off the track, son; your
<a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>interests are mine. And wait till
you get your teeth into this
one. Books, Ben boy. Books!
People are spending all their
time sitting in on Tri-deo,
not reading. People should
read more, Ben. Gives them
that healthy tired feeling.
Now we have the product. We
have senior Robo-writers with
more circuits than ever before.
All possible information,
every conceivable plot. Maybe
a saturation guilt type campaign
to start&mdash;but it&#8217;s up to
you, Ben. I don&#8217;t care how you
do it, but move books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Books, eh? Well, now.&rdquo;
Ben was interested. &ldquo;Funny
thing, sir, but that ties in
with something I was thinking
about just last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have an angle? Good
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Well, it is a wild
thought maybe, but last summer
when I was on vacation I
met a man up at that new
camp and&mdash;well, I know it
sounds silly, but he was writing
a book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought, sir.
But I read some of it and, I
don&#8217;t know, it had a sort of a
feel about it. Something new,
sir, it might catch on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, all right. That&#8217;s
enough. You&#8217;re a salesman.
You&#8217;ve sold me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the book?&rdquo; Ben was
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit pulling an old man&#8217;s
leg, Ben. I&#8217;m sold on your
needing a vacation. I&#8217;ll fill out
<!-- 024.png p37 column 2 -->your vacation pass right
now.&rdquo; The Old Man, still a
vigorous, vital figure, turned
and walked back to his Desk-sec.
&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; said the secretarial
voice, &ldquo;got it. Vacation
clearance for Tilman, Ben,
any resort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And family,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And family. Very good,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Old Man made his sign
on the pass and said heavily,
&ldquo;All right then, Ben. That&#8217;s it.
Maybe if you go back up to
that place for a few days and
see that psycho who was writing
a book again, perhaps
you&#8217;ll realize how impractical
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But sir! I&#8217;m serious about
that book. It really did <span class="nw">have&mdash;</span>&rdquo;
he broke off.</p>


<div class="illus"><a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span

 /></span><img src="images/illo36.png" width="384" height="536"
 alt="" title="he reached across toward the
hearing aid on the Old Man&#8217;s
chest" /></div>

<p>The Old Man was sitting
there, face blank, withdrawn.
Ben could feel he wasn&#8217;t even
listening. That damned hearing
aid of his. The Old Man
had cut it off. Suddenly, unreasoningly,
Ben was furious.
He stood by the huge desk and
he reached across toward the
hearing aid on the Old Man&#8217;s
chest to turn up the volume.
The Old Man looked up and
saw Ben&#8217;s hand stretching out.</p>

<p>A sudden look of fear came
into his china blue, clear eyes
but he made no move. He sat
frozen in his chair.</p>

<p>Ben hesitated a second.
&ldquo;What&mdash;?&rdquo; But he didn&#8217;t have
to ask. He knew.</p>

<p>And he also knew what he
was going to do.</p>

<p><a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the Old Man.
&ldquo;No, Ben. I&#8217;ve only been trying
to help; trying to serve
your best interests the best
way I know. Ben, you <span class="nw">mustn&#8217;t&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ben moved forward.<br class="ns" /></p>


<p class="noindent tb"><span class="drop">H</span><span class="uc">e</span> took the plastic box on
the Old Man&#8217;s chest and
firmly cut the switch.</p>

<p>The Old Man, the Robot Old
Man, went lifeless and slumped
back in his chair as Ben
stretched to cut off the Desk-sec.
Then he picked up his vacation
clearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robots can&#8217;t sell, eh?&rdquo; he
said to the dead machine behind
the desk. &ldquo;Well, you
couldn&#8217;t sell me that time,
could you, Old Man?&rdquo;<!-- original lacks closing quote --></p>

<p>Clumsily, rustily, Ben whistled
a cheerful little off-key
tune to himself. Hell, they
could do anything at all&mdash;except
sell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&#8217;t fool some of the
people all of the time,&rdquo; he remarked
over his shoulder to
the still, silent figure of the
Old Man as he left the office,
&ldquo;it was a man said that.&rdquo; He
closed the door softly behind
him.</p>

<p>Betty would be waiting.</p>

<p>Betty was waiting. Her
head ached as she bounced
Bennie, the child of Ben, of
herself and of an unknown
egg cell from an anonymous
ovary, on her knees. Betty
3-RC-VIII, secret, wife-style
model, the highest development
of the art of Robotics
<!-- 026.png p38 column 2 -->had known instantly when
Ben cut the Old Man&#8217;s switch.
She had half expected it. But
it made her headache worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But damn my programming!&rdquo;
She spoke abruptly,
aloud, nervously fingering the
locket around her neck.
&ldquo;Damn it and shift circuit.
He&#8217;s right! He is my husband
and he is right and I&#8217;m glad.
I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re going to the
camp and I&#8217;m going to help
him stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all, why shouldn&#8217;t a
man want to do things just as
much as a robot? He had
energy, circuits, feelings too.
She knew he did.</p>

<p>For herself, she loved her
Ben and Bennie. But still just
that wasn&#8217;t enough occupation.
She was glad they were
going to the new isolation
compound for non-psychotic
but unstable, hyper-active,
socially dangerous individual
humans. At the camp there
would be things to do.</p>

<p>At the camp they would be
happy.</p>

<p>All at once the headache
that had been bothering her
so these past months was
gone. She felt fine and she
smiled at little Bennie. &ldquo;Bennie-boy,&rdquo;
she said, kissing his
smooth, untroubled baby forehead.
&ldquo;Daddy&#8217;s coming.&rdquo; Bennie
laughed and started to
reach for the locket around
Mommy&#8217;s neck. But just then
the door opened and he jumped
down to run and meet his
daddy.</p>
